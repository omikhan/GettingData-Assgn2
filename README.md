GettingData-Assgn2
==================
*There is one R script file run_analysis.R. 
*You need to unzip the data folder in your working folder. So you would have directory named 'UCI HAR Dataset' in your working
folder. 
*This file uses package 'reshape2', so you need to install that package. 
*The script will store the output tidy data in the file names "tidyData.txt" in your working directory.
